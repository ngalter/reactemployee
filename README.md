## Employee Directory 
The React Employee Directory provides the user with access to the the employee's name, email, state, age and image.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to employee information. The directory is searchable by first and last name.  Last name is sortable, as are all the other fields (excluding image).

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Specifications
The React Employee Directory was written using React, JavaScript, JSX, react-dom, axios and Bootstrap.  An api call is made to the randomuser.me api to seed the employee directory.

The React Employee Directory is deployed on Heroku at: https://who-works-here.herokuapp.com/
